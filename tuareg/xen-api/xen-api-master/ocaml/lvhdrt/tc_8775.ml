(* Test description:

   1. Setup a pool of at least 2 hosts with a shared LVHD storage;
   2. create a VDI, snapshot it;
   3. on each host, do a attach/detach loop of the snapshot VDI.

   attach should inflate the snapshot VDI, detach should deflate it. This test should check that nothing bad happens ... *)
