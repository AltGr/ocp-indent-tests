(** [normalize length_fun thing_with_length i] is just [i], unless

(** [get_pos_len] and [get_pos_len_exn] are intended to be used by functions
    *  that take a sequence (array, string, bigstring, ...) and an optional [pos]
    *  and [len] specifying a subrange of the sequence.  Such functions should call
    *  [get_pos_len] with the length of the sequence and the optional [pos] and
    *  [len], and it will return the [pos] and [len] specifying the range, where
    *  the default [pos] is zero and the default [len] is to go to the end of the
    *  sequence.
    *
    *  It should be the case that:
    *
    *    0 <= pos <= length
    *    len >= 0
    *    pos + len <= length
    *
    *  Note that this allows [pos = length] and [len = 0], i.e. an empty subrange
    *  at the end of the sequence.
    *
    *  [get_pos_len] returns [(pos', len')] specifying a subrange where:
    *
    *    pos' = match pos with None -> 0 | Some i -> i
    *    len' = match len with None -> length - pos | Some i -> i
