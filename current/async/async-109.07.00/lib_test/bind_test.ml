(* What are the semantics of these tests? We would like to verify
   that if we attach a removable callback to a deferred, and
   then that deferred gets modified by a [connect] (this means
   it had to be a bind, and its callback needs to fire after
   we attached the removable callback), we would like to verify that the
   callback is still removed.  The steps are relatively
   simple, but arranging all of the callbacks to fire in the
   right order is not.

   Deferreds are numbered in the order they should be filled.
   Ivars named retX represent Ivars that are filled in order to
   ensure all necessary callbacks are called.
