(** This is a description of the function [f], placed immediately above the function *)
val f : 'a -> 'b

(** This is a description of the function [g], placed immediately above the function,
 *  while leaving at least one empty line after the previous function. *)
val g : int -> unit

(** Besides functions, also other elements such as types and exceptions have comments.
 *  Note that also the values of a type are given descriptions of their own. *)
type t =

    b : int;  (** [b] is an awesome number *)
  }

type q =

  | AnotherTest      (** More testing *)

  Additional comments, not associated to any element can be inserted anywhere.
  This gives me the oppotunity to introduce some fancy formatting options, such as
  - a bulleted list
  - of items

  Or a numbered list:
  + like
  + this

  Text can be formatted as [source code], {i in italics}, {b in bold face}, and
  links to a function such as {!Module.function} can be used.

  Additional formatting options are listed in the OCamlDoc manual:
