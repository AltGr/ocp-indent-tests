    during operation, or a timeout occurred on the socket during sending.
    It is currently impossible to find out which of the events above
    happened.  Calling {!sendfile} several times on the same descriptor
    that only partially accepted data due to a timeout will eventually
    lead to the unix error [EAGAIN].

    before or while executing this system call.  To make sure that you
    do not miss this event, you should call {!getppid} to get
    the parent process id after this system call.  If the parent has
    died, the returned parent PID will be 1, i.e. the init process will

(** {2 Affinity} *)

(* Setting the CPU affinity causes a process to only run on the
   cores chosen.  You can find out how many cores a system has in
   /proc/cpuinfo.  This can be useful in two ways: first, it limits
   a process to a core so that it won't interfere with processes on
   other cores.  Second, you save time by not moving the process back
   and forth between CPUs, which sometimes invalidates their cache.
   See "man sched_setaffinity" for details. *)

      the set of file descriptors that one is interested in, and the flags associated with
