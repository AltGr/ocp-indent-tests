(** A bag is a data structure like a set, except that:

    - It doesn't require anything (hashable, comparable) of elements in the bag.
    - Duplicates are allowed.
    - Addition and removal are constant time.

    It is an error to modify a bag (add, remove, remove_one, ...) during iteration (fold,
    iter, ...).  *)
