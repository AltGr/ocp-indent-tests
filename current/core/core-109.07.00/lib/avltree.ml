(* We do this 'crazy' magic because we want to remove a level of
   indirection in the tree. If we didn't do this, we'd need to use a
   record, and then the variant would be a block with a pointer to
   the record. Where as now the 'record' is tagged with the
   constructor, thus removing a level of indirection. This is even
   reasonably safe, certainly no more dangerous than a C binding.
   The extra checking is probably free, since the block will already
   be in L1 cache, and the branch predictor is very likely to
   predict correctly. *)
