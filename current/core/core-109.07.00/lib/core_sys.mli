    main execution context.  Consider explicitly handling Signal.int instead.  If
    all you want to do is terminate on CTRL-C you don't have to do any special setup,
    that's the default behavior.

   [catch_break] governs whether interactive interrupt (ctrl-C) terminates the

    raising [Break], and [catch_break false] to let the system terminate the
    program on user interrupt.
