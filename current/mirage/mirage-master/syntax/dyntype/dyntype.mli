(** {2 Utility functions} *)

(** [is_mutable t] checks whether [t] contains a mutable field *)
val is_mutable : t -> bool

(** [free_vars t] returns all the free variables of type [t].
   If [t] is unfolded (as it should be when calling [type_of_t],
   this call should return an empty list. *)
val free_vars : t -> string list

(** [foreigns t] returns all the type variables appearing in [t]. *)
val foreigns : t -> string list

(** [unroll env t] replaces every type appearing in [t] by its type value defined in [env]. *)
val unroll : (string * t) list -> t -> t


(** {2 Sub-typing} *)

(** [is_subtype_of s t] checks whether [s] is a sub-type of [t]. Sub-typing relation is based on
   naming. Basically, [s] is a sub-type of [t] if (i) named attributes have either compatible types
   (ii) or some fields/methods defined in [t] do not appear in [s]. *)
val is_subtype_of : t -> t -> bool

(** [s <: t] is a short-cut for [is_subtype_of s t] *)
val ( <: ) : t -> t -> bool

(** Returns the more recent failing sub-type relation tested by [(<:)] or [is_subtype_of] *)
val string_of_last_type_error : unit -> string

(** {2 Pretty-printing} *)

(** [to_string t] pretty-prints the type [t] *)
val to_string : t -> string


(** Exception that may be raised by [!of_string] *)
exception Parse_error of string

(** [of_string str] returns the type [t] corresponding to the pretty-printed string [str]. Raises [!Parse_error]
   if is not a valid string *)
val of_string : string -> t
